# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. In this project, I created a model that will help predict this.

I used lending data from 2007-2010 and applied Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. In the end, I compared the results from both methods to wee which is best suitable for this case.

This project is part of Pierien Data's Bootcamp, "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning".
